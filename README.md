# milestone-02

1. Project Name: Baseball Analytics
  
2. Project Objective
The problem that I am solving is finding out which players are the most valuable athletes in the MLB.

I am solving this problem by gathering stats from ESPN

3. Job Description
Baseball Data Analyst

The company that I would for this was from the San Francisco Giants. The job description including knowledge in SQL and data visulization which I feel familar in both. This gives me a great opurtunity to use platforms like Jupiter Notebook and MySQL to combine two skills I feel familiar with.

4. Data
https://www.espn.com/mlb/history/leaders/_/type/pitching/breakdown/season/year/2021/sort/ERA

https://www.espn.com/mlb/history/awards/_/year/2021

https://www.espn.com/mlb/history/leaders/_/breakdown/season/year/2021/start/{}

Each of these link provides stats on MLB players and I gathered those by web scraping.

5. Notebooks

[hitting_stats.csv](https://github.com/dbarrer5/milestone-02/files/8633209/hitting_stats.csv)
[awards.csv](https://github.com/dbarrer5/milestone-02/files/8633211/awards.csv)
[pitching_stats.csv](https://github.com/dbarrer5/milestone-02/files/8633213/pitching_stats.csv)

CSV files with data. Jupiter notebooks not supported

6. Future improvements
If I had more time on this project I would add more data from different websites such as Teams, coaches, all players, and more stats not provided on ESPN.
